The ancient bloodline of Custos was blessed by the land of Aeon with the power to protect; not to conquer, not to intimidate, but to protect the land and the people within. As time progressed, the descendants Custos began to abuse their gift and the power quickly faded.

Thousands of years later, this power has awoken in a young man blessed with the drive to protect every human and creature within Aeon, just to have his father and his ruler taken away from him by the person closest to him. Having been blamed for the murder of the former Lord Custos, the new leader of Aeon is hell bent on the young man’s execution. The man’s new drive for justice and revenge reduces his inner power so he’s left powerless and leaves him no choice but to run.

When he meets and falls in love with a women, his drive to protect her rekindles the power within and pushes it beyond the limits of the men of old, making him more powerful than ever imagined. Even that happiness is being threatened by his past. As emotions conflict, he makes a decision that will change the fate of many innocents, and the future of Aeon.
